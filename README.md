Title: Roll Dice 

 

A Brief Description of Project: 

This Project aims to implement the Throw of dice and gives moves of dice and latest position by user. 

Installation Instructions:

Function does- 

Random Module: 

To use this module first import Random Module from library. 

Shuffle ():  

Python number method shuffle () randomizes the items of a list in place. 

We can import this from random module.  

import random 

i=[[1,6], [3,4], [2,5]] 

random. Shuffle(i) 

 

right roll (): To roll right side 

left roll (): To roll left side 

up roll (): To roll up side 

down roll (): To roll down side 

random. Shuffle ()

Click: 

R -To roll right side 

L - To roll left side 

U -To roll upside 

D -To roll Downside 

Q -> to quit 

Pick your move: 

  

Pick your move: R 
 
then the position of the dice should change accordingly. 

  

And print the latest position 

  

If user picks other than the options (R, L, U, D) it should prompt ‘INVALID MOVE’ 

  

If user picks ‘Q’ it should print all the moves and the latest positions. 

 

->> algorithm for Rolling Dice 

   

step 1: First import the random module for shuffling dice and                  also import the copy. 

  

step 2: Take a list like --[1,2,3,4,5,6] or [[1,6], [3,4], [2,5]] 

  

step 3: Draw a dice and print that dice. 

  

step 4: print the Individual value on dice by using index.                            [positions: right,left,up,bottom]. 

  

step 5: And then Put the dice inside the function. 

  

step 6: Take another function to rotate right and left and up                     and down and then swap the values for changing the                   dice positions.  

  

step 7: And then Write a While loop for to pick the particular                   move. 

  

step 8: And user to ask enter the move. 

  

step 9: Write the if condition to check the particular move or not. 

  

step 10:  And then with in the if we called the defined function                   and also count. 

  

step 11:  count the moves. 

  

step 12:  Then After pick the move Like quit(q) and its append                      to the empty list and then print the all moves of dice                     and latest position by using deep copy.   

  

step 13:  Finally, if user Enter any wrong input its break the                          loop and print the "It is invalid move".
